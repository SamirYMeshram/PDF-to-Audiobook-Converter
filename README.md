# **üìò PDF to Audiobook Converter**  

## **üìñ Overview**  
The **PDF to Audiobook Converter** is a Python-based desktop application that allows users to convert PDF files into audiobooks. This versatile tool supports both text-based and image-based PDFs. It first tries to extract text directly from the PDF using **pdfplumber**. If the PDF contains scanned images or embedded text, it switches to **OCR (Optical Character Recognition)** using **easyocr**.  

Once the text is extracted, the application converts it into clear, human-like speech using **pyttsx3**, and saves the output as an **MP3 audiobook file**. The user can also play the audiobook directly from the app using an intuitive, user-friendly graphical user interface (GUI) built with **Tkinter**.  

This project aims to make audiobooks accessible to everyone and helps users convert their favorite PDF e-books, articles, and documents into portable audio files.

## **‚ú® Key Features**  
- **Dual Text Extraction**: Extracts text directly from PDFs or via OCR for image-based PDFs.  
- **Text-to-Speech Conversion**: Converts extracted text into clear, human-like speech.  
- **Audiobook File Generation**: Saves the audiobook in MP3 format in a dedicated folder.  
- **In-App Audiobook Player**: Play the audiobook directly from the application.  
- **Interactive GUI**: User-friendly interface for PDF uploads, audiobook generation, and playback.  
- **Multi-threaded Processing**: Ensures a smooth, non-blocking user experience.  
- **Error Handling**: Alerts users when issues occur (like missing files or processing failures).

## **üìö How to Use the Application**  
1. **Launch the Application**: Run `main.py` to open the PDF to Audiobook Converter.  
2. **Upload a PDF File**: Click on the **Upload PDF** button to select a PDF from your system.  
3. **Wait for Text Extraction**: The application will extract text from the PDF (via **pdfplumber** or **OCR** if needed).  
4. **Generate Audiobook**: The extracted text is converted into an audiobook and saved in the **audiobooks** folder as an MP3 file.  
5. **Play Audiobook**: Click the **Play Audiobook** button to listen to the generated audiobook.

## **üìã Algorithm**  

Here is a detailed step-by-step explanation of how the system works.  

### **1Ô∏è‚É£ Upload PDF**  
- The user selects a PDF file using the file dialog.  
- The file path is captured, and a background thread is started to process the file.  

### **2Ô∏è‚É£ Text Extraction**  
- **Step 1**: Attempt to extract text directly using **pdfplumber**.  
- **Step 2**: If no text is extracted, convert the PDF to images using **pdf2image**.  
- **Step 3**: Use **easyocr** to extract text from each image, page-by-page.  

### **3Ô∏è‚É£ Text-to-Speech Conversion**  
- **Step 4**: Process the extracted text to improve punctuation spacing for better speech clarity.  
- **Step 5**: Convert the processed text into speech using **pyttsx3**.  
- **Step 6**: Save the audiobook as an **MP3 file** in the **audiobooks** folder.  

### **4Ô∏è‚É£ Audiobook Player**  
- **Step 7**: User can play the generated audiobook directly from the app using **playsound**.
